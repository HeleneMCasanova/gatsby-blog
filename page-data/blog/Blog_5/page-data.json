I have also been trying to find a way to make my bullet journal work for me now that I am no longer in school. I thought that I would need more space for daily tasks, but the more menial things, I have found, that writing them down hinders me from actually doing it.</p>\n<p>I created a new cover page for this new chapter in my life; everytime something changes in my life, I like to do something like this because it gives me a new percepective on the coming weeks.</p>\n<img src = \"/static/media/b_5_2.8ab9cad3.JPG\" style = \"width:100%; text-align:center\"/>\n<p>I've decided to switch up the way I plan out my weeks. Below I have picture of what my weeks used to look like as I've decided to do this again because I've found it works well with what I am planning to accomplish in the coming months. This spread is EXTREMLY minimal, but was functional. </p>\n<img src = \"/static/media/b_5_3.0770a613.JPG\" style = \"width:100%; text-align:center\"/>\n<p>As you can see, I've listed what I need to accomplish on the left page and then I used the right side to plan out my week. This also makes it easier to transfer over todo's from week to week. Here is one I used a few weeks ago that was more decorative. It wasn't as functional as I would have preferred which frusterated me and caused to to not use it.</p>\n<img src = \"/static/media/b_5_4.dbb22e06.JPG\" style = \"width:100%; text-align:center\"/>\n<p>So, I decided to have a mix between comfortable and decorative! (I started on Tuesday because Sunday was my birthday and I was still recovering from the weekend)</p>\n<img src = \"/static/media/b_5_5.69877e4a.JPG\" style = \"width:100%; text-align:center\"/>\n<p>I also decided to do a brain dump page because I was feeling cluttered and disorganized so, I decieded to put it all down and organize in different spreads.</p>\n<img src = \"/static/media/b_5_6.f818dfb4.JPG\" style = \"width:100%; text-align:center\"/>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"Blog_5"}}}
