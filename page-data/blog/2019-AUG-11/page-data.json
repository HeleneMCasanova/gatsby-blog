I'm graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'm blogging. I don't have a job yet or a place to live in September so, I can say that things are going pretty well.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried to do this several different times - blogging. I will write one or two blog posts, feel on top of the world, and then forget it ever existed. Then one day I’ll actually organize all the out of control files on my computer and find these cringe worthy blog posts which never seemed to have much passion or effort put in them at all. </p>\n<p>I am not one of those “New year, New me” people (granted it is almost September, but that is besides the point) because the phrase makes absolutely no sense in my eyes and implies that you will somehow stop being who you previously were. I really do love the person I am and as I look down the path for my future, I see the person I am with an amazing work ethic, impecable time management skills and a killer sense of style.</p>\n<p>I am not saying I don’t already possess some of these qualities, but that even if you believe you’re the “best”, there will always be someone better than you. So, that’s why everyday I work harder than I did the previous day because I know that this will pay off.</p>\n<p>So for the rest of this year, let’s coin the term - “Work Harder”.</p>\n<p>This gives me my segway into the start of my blogging journey. I am an organizer, well bullet journaler, so I thought I would share that with “the world” (or a very small audience). I am also going to attempt to blend my organizing world with my organization world. </p>\n</div>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"2019-AUG-11"}}}
