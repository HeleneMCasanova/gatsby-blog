I always wanted to do something new, teach myself a new trade or hone a new skill because I wanted to be a well rounded person - a true autodidact. I am still this way today and I am quite astonished at the amount of skills I have under my belt. I say this not out of narcissism or arrogance, but it stems from the fact that I shouldn’t have been able to accomplish everything I have according to statistics and others opinions of me. I have recently released a novel entitled Journal 1: Belle and I am currently in the planning stages of the next four novels to be released in the series. </p>\n<p>The enigma in my situation is that I am a full-time college student that is a Computer Science major with a raging interest in cryptography and anything security related. I know I have just blown your mind.</p>\n<p>Well writing isn’t my only hobby. On the list of things I do regularly include bullet journaling, reading, writing implementations of ciphers and I paint as well. All of the things I chose to fill my day with, make my day a little brighter and I made myself a promise I would never give up any of them. I also told myself that if I was going to do this, I had to make sure I followed through.</p>\n<p>That was (and sometimes still is) and issue of mine - the follow through. Sometimes I become so enthralled with one activity that I forget I was working on it and stumble upon it a year later with feelings of regret and slightly pitying myself for not completing the project.</p>\n<p>I rarely do that anymore.</p>\n<p>After I completed my first novel, I realized the potential I have inside me. I came to the conclusion that I have the potential to be Helene. I do not want to be the next Steve Jobs, but rather the first of my kind.</p>\n<p>I am lucky that I have the ability to document my journey because I want to have the ability to look back at this for encouragement and optimism when I’m not feeling 100 percent. I am a simple nerd following through with a promise she made to herself a while ago - to become someone better than you were yesterday. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"2019-AUG-11-4"}}}
