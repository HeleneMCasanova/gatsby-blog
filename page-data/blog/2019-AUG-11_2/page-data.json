I had accomplished more in that year then I had expected was possible in 5. Sometimes changing only one aspect of your life can have a significant impact on your mentality which can lead you to getting to your goals quicker. </p>\n<p>I started to bullet journal - that’s the highlight. I had always been fascinated with the system as I have been an avid planner since high school. It was always the same routine, I would start the year off strong with a new planner and then life would get in the way, so I would eventually use it less and less until it sat on my desk collecting dust. </p>\n<p>I had wanted to start a bullet journal for some time before I actually did, but was afraid of ruining a pretty notebook or not actually using the planner I was already in (I had spent a good amount on previous planners and was determined to stick to it even if I was unhappy with it). </p>\n<p>2017 was a year of a lot of misfortune in my life and by the summer time, I had lost a lost hope that anything would get any better. </p>\n<p>In the summer of 2017, I was working full time at an IT desk at a college in Boston where I would spend a lot of time sitting around doing absolutely nothing. Not only did I feel like my CS degree was not being put to good use, but I also felt like this summer was going to be a huge waste of my time. It was towards the end of my first month there that I had a realization; I would not sit around and wait for things to come to me, but work hard until my dreams become a reality. </p>\n<p>I knew the start of this journey would need to be one of organization so, I started to work out of the planner that I got in January, but it did not seem to satisfy my needs; I needed something more. </p>\n<p>I had refounded some bullet journal videos and binged watched at least 100 of them that next week - I had officially become addicted. I grabbed one of my large 5 dollar sketch books from Michaels and began with absolutely no regrets because from that moment forward I knew no one could stop me in my future endeavors. </p>\n<p>My first task was to continue on a project that I had started back in November. I was a participant in Nanowrimo 2016 and only got to around 8,000 words before I realized that writing a book and taking a full Computer Science course load was near impossible. I had stop because of the affect it was having on my mental health; I was not getting much sleep and it was affecting how much I could time I could put into my coursework. </p>\n<p>I always promised myself that school and mental health come first, so that is what I did - I put it down. It was a sad moment, but I knew that in the long run, it would be better for me. I gave myself 2 months to complete the book and I knew by the end of the summer, it had to be done. </p>\n<p>I did it. I wrote a book last summer.\nAnd now by the end of February 2018, my book will be edited and self-published. It's insane, I know. I still am in awe that I was able to accomplish this, but I owe all the credit to my bullet journal. She kept me on track and without her, I don't believe that would have been possible.</p>\n<p>So, meet Bullet Journal Beta, the first of her kind which was succeeded by future ones and the one I am working in now!</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures of my first attempt at bullet journaling. It’s strange (and kind of cringy) to see how far I’ve come in my bullet journal journey. As these pictures show, anyone can bullet journal, and with practice, you’ll find your system!</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><em>FYI, you can buy my book here: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PXB3bN\">https://amzn.to/2PXB3bN</a></em></em></p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"2019-AUG-11_2"}}}
