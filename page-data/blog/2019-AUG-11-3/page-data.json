I had accomplished more in that year then I had expected was possible in 5. Sometimes changing only one aspect of your life can have a significant impact on your mentality which can lead you to getting to your goals quicker.\nEver since I began my journey into bullet journaling, I made sure to share my love of it with the people around, because this is truly one of my passions (and favorite hobby). I often hear the phrases “I could never do something like that” or “I’m not artsy enough to do that”, but the truth is I’m not either. I’m a budding software developer which is one of the furthest things away from an arts degree. My point is, if the computer scientist who spends most of her days at a keyboard can do it, so can you!</p>\n<p>I know it can seem overwhelming seeing all those artistic page spreads on pinterest and tumblr, but the truth is, all you need is a journal and a pen to begin.</p>\n<p>There is the “Official” bullet journal notebook, the Leuchtturm1917, or a 5 dollar journal from Michaels. This journal is yours and you should use whatever notebook you are most comfortable using. </p>\n<p>Any good blogger will tell you that you need to go watch Ryder Carroll's video as he is the inventor of the bullet journaling method. His video explains what bullet journaling is in simple terms, minimalistic terms which shows you how simple the system actually is. </p>\n<p><em>Watch Ryder Carroll’s video here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfRf43JTqY4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfRf43JTqY4</a></em>\n<br></br></p>\n<p>Now, we can keep it simple like Carroll has shown, we can go into the world of pinterest and tumblr worthy spread, or any where in the middle. </p>\n<p>You can use a simple spiral notebook you may get at any dollar store or Target or you can get a little fancier (The options are honestly endless).</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>I will be doing a more in depth blog post on my favorite supplies, but here are some links to get you started:</p>\n<p>Black and Faux Rose Gold Monogram Notebook: <em><a href=\"https://www.zazzle.com/black_and_faux_rose_gold_monogram_notebook-130661938968231945?rf=238083689008965755\">https://www.zazzle.com/black_and_faux_rose_gold_monogram_notebook-130661938968231945?rf=238083689008965755</a></em></p>\n<p>Minimalism Art, Classic Notebook Journal: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZLnX5T\">https://amzn.to/2ZLnX5T</a></em></p>\n<p>Leuchtturm1917 Medium A5 Dotted Hardcover Notebook: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2A2Ljoa\">https://amzn.to/2A2Ljoa</a></em></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>Some of my favorite bullet journalers on YouTube are:</p>\n<p><em>Studyign: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TV5acMx_3Mzsdbts93liA\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TV5acMx_3Mzsdbts93liA</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Boho Berry: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTjjS_Cqrde9bR9Gz4PqdA\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPTjjS_Cqrde9bR9Gz4PqdA</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Bullet Journal (Official Page): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3B6rUXb__X2eMyY7jzgIg\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3B6rUXb__X2eMyY7jzgIg</a></em></p>\n<p><em>AmandaRachLee: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk9aeo2A6a1fg3VeRueTn9w\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk9aeo2A6a1fg3VeRueTn9w</a></em>\n<br></br></p>\n<p>These are just my favorite, but that doesn’t mean I limit myself to this incredible group of people because there are thousands of channels out there.
